Keep track of boolean inside variable called 'used'
Upon first assignation, see if it's been used before, if not, just move to beginning and assign it
(How to move to beginning and assign? Maybe run through first, see when it's used, and save that data, then look at that data
when you're printing out, and see if it's been used by the time you assign it first, or assign it a second time.
