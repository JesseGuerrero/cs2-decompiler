☐ Fix switch statement defaults (I think there's an issue)
☐ Get && and || working for if statements
☐ Change calc methods to simply display the equations, instead of calc(x + y)
☐ Get most component, or colour values changed to if_gethash for interfaces, and hex codes for colours
☐ If people really want, can change if_xxxx(if_gethash(hash), value) to getComponent(inter, comp).xxxx (rather not)

Long term:
    ☐ Ensure all instructions are popping and returning what they should
    ☐ Perhaps set switch statements to order there cases going from smallest to largest integer, most are but some arent
    ☐ Clean up instruction-processor processInstruction method. Should not have to return the index, looks disgusting
    ☐ Identify most instructions
